Welcome to **Smart Voting System**, a simple, secure, and beginner-friendly web-based voting application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — designed to simulate the core idea of using **Aadhar authentication** for casting votes digitally.

## 📌 Project Objective

This project was created to demonstrate how **secure, Aadhar-based digital voting** could work in a simplified web environment. It allows authenticated users (via mock Aadhar logic) to cast their votes and prevents multiple voting attempts. Admins can monitor voting results in real-time.
